# COSC 315 Database Detectives
Name: Katie Boarman
Date: February 4, 2026

## Task Results
For this assignment, I will be using the COSC315DD database on the CS Development Server. Before exploring the database, I assume it contains multiple related tables with primary and foreign key relationships. I also assume the data represents a realistic scenario which may contain some inconsistencies or missing values in the data set. Additionally, I expect that meaningful insights will require joining tables rather than relying on a singular table.
